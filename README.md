### About me :ðŸ˜ƒ
## As a Software Development Engineer, I am curious about technology and its applications to address real-world challenges. I excel at tackling complex problems, carefully weighing the tradeoffs to design effective solutions. My approach to implementation is hands-on; I believe in building rapidly and learning through experimentation.
